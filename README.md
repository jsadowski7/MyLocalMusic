## Description
Streaming services today have made it easier than ever to listen to music from all around the world, but with unlimited access to artists, finding and supporting local bands has become more difficult. With Austin being the music capital of the world, MyLocalMusic strives to connect Austinites with local bands and allowing the user to save artists that they have seen live.
